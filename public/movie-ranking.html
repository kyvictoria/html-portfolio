<h1>Ky's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>The Ultimate Top 5</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon 2</h3>
<p>This underrated sequel is often overlooked in comparison to its predecessor, How to Train Your Dragon. However, the plot of this movie is fantastic as it further pushes our protagonist's, Hiccup Haddock the Third, characterization and expands on this fantastic world.  </p>
<h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
<p>This movie is known by all as the ultimate Spiderman movie, enjoyable to fans of all ages.</p>
<h3>Rush Hour 2</h3>
<p>Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker absolutely carry this movie, which I would argue is one of the funniest movies of all time.</p>
<h3>Princess and the Frog</h3>
<p>Prince Naveen is my personal favorite prince, and the music in this movie is fantastic.</p>
<h3>Instant Family</h3>
<p>This movie follows a middle-aged couple as they embark on new territory: adopting a new family.</p>
